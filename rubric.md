# Project Assessment Rubric

**Project:** Dota Hero Matchup Helper
**Section:** C2A
**Course:** Object Oriented Programming

## Grading Breakdown

### 1. Class Diagram Completeness (25%)
**Score:** 5/5
**Notes:** Complete UML diagram provided (UML diagram.png) with clear class relationships showing Hero, CounterSystem, and DotaMatchupHelper classes. The diagram shows proper associations and dependencies. Additionally, a FigJam link is provided for collaborative viewing. Both the PNG file and Figma link demonstrate thorough planning and documentation.

### 2. Java Program - OOP Concepts (50%)
**Score:** 3/5
**Notes:**
- **Encapsulation (Present):** Private fields in Hero class (name, role, counters) with public getters and methods for controlled access. CounterSystem properly encapsulates the heroes ArrayList.
- **Abstraction (Limited):** No abstract classes or interfaces used. All classes are concrete implementations.
- **Inheritance (Missing):** No inheritance hierarchy demonstrated in the project.
- **Polymorphism (Missing):** No method overriding or interface implementations present.

The project demonstrates good encapsulation practices with proper use of private fields and public methods. However, it lacks inheritance and polymorphism, which are fundamental OOP concepts. The code is well-structured but could benefit from using abstract classes or interfaces to demonstrate more advanced OOP principles.

### 3. Git Usage & Collaboration (15%)
**Score:** 4/5
**Notes:** Good collaboration evident with 14 total commits from 4 contributors: unknown (6 commits), t0bipogi (5 commits), Michael Ong (2 commits), and williethepooh (1 commit). The repository shows active teamwork with multiple contributors, though the commit distribution could be more balanced. Git usage demonstrates solid version control practices for a team project.
